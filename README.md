# Gr-Affable | Hello FOSS 2022

Welcome to **Gr-Affable**, a project on DSA and Graph Theory under **Hello FOSS 2022** !

Here, We explore algorithms with special emphasis on Graph Theory. 

Algorithms play a crutial role in Computer Science. Best algorithms ensure that the computer perform a task in the most efficient manner. A Good Algorithm is extremely needed for optimizing a program. We will think for better algorithms that are possible for solving problems. 

Many programming problems can be solved by modeling them as a Graph problem and using appropriate graph algorithm. There are many clever and efficient graph algorithms that can resolve difficult problems effectively. We will get to know about these Algorithms while solving the problems here.

## Guidelines
- Clone the repository into your local devices by following command
```
git clone <link of the repository>
```
- Explore various problems that are provided here, think on there implementation. Try to solve them first. If you can think of a better solution, do implement it. We have provided some hints and ideas to start with
- Some of the problems have a code for it. Try to see if that code works. If not, do contribute to that code and make it more efficient.
- You may start with the following order if you wish :
    - Sorting and Searching
    - Symphony
    - Communication
    - Grid Ways
    - Maze
    - Check Paths
    - Dijkstra
    - Bellman Ford
- Enjoy DSA and Graphs!
