# Gr-Affable | Hello FOSS 2022

Welcome to **Gr-Affable**, a project on DSA and Graph Theory under **Hello FOSS 2022** !

Here, We explore algorithms with special emphasis on Graph Theory.

Many programming problems can be solved by modeling them as a Graph problem and using appropriate graph algorithm. There are many clever and efficient graph algorithms that can resolve difficult problems effectively. We will get to know about these Algorithms while solving the problems here.

We embark upon a rather ambitious journey - to design algorithms for a self-driving car! How does your car move when given the map of a city? What routes does it take? Code your way out of the traffic on the city streets!

## Guidelines

- Take any input/output format you see fit, if the problem doesn't mentions it. This is not an autograded lab ;)  
- Explore various problems that are provided here, think on there implementation. Try to solve them first. If you can think of a better solution, do implement it. We have provided some hints and ideas to start with
- Some of the problems have a code for it. Try to see if that code works. If not, do contribute to that code and make it more efficient.
